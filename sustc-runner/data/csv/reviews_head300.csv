"1","34","25","William Hakala","5","3 medium onions made a very tasty part of a meal for 3 persons. The recipe ingredients reads ""20 butter"" and ""onions"" but doesn't say  how many.  I used about a 1/2 C. butter and 3 medium onions & it worked out fine and the cooking time seemed to be the right time.  3 med. onions would serve 4 people. They would be really yummy atop a thick juicy filet mignon! In fact, I believe that this recipe could be included with a large number of meals of various types.

"9","9","88","Gina Lukhart","1","As a German National, growing up in the birthplace of Spaetzle in the Swabian community, having had Spaetzle twice a week since I can remember, I have to tell you that Spaetzle are not made with milk. You just use water. In the old days Spaetzles dough was made thinner and put on a cuttingboard then scraped into boiling water. It only takes a couple of minutes..less then 5, for Spaetzle to be done. I actually have a spaetzlesmachine where you fill in the dough and it comes out looking like spagetti, but you stir them up and they break a little, cookingtime is 2 minutes...once they boil take them out. Spaetzlesmachine is much like a potatoricer, there are places on the web where you can buy those. Thats authentic Spaetzle. Sometimes my Mom just made Spaetzle, browned some onions in butter and put them over the spaetzle, serve with a fresh green salad and you got a complete meal.","2001-05-30T13:26:29Z","2001-05-30T13:26:29Z",""

My houmous recipe is similar but without the cumin. Always top with extra virgin olive oil; never use vegetable oil (it won''t give the authentic, rich, fragrant middle-eastern taste or fragrance).
For a change: rub pita bread with cut garlic cloves-brush with olive oil-toast in oven until crispy and cut into triangles.  Or just scoop it up with non toasted pita.
Serve with olives-middle-eastern, small green ones, if you can find them (Atlantic Ave.,Brooklyn, NY, or in a city with a large arabic population, look for an Arab grocery).
